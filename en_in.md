## Fun Activities

- I want to get started with HF in 30 minutes? Tell me how!

  Build a 10mW WSPR beacon for 10m band using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 MCU board.

  Use https://github.com/kholia/Easy-Beacons-STEM.

  Alternate: Already own a Raspberry Pi SBC? Then try https://github.com/JamesP6000/WsprryPi.

- I want to start receive HF traffic today - tell me how!

  - RTL-SDR v3 + random wire / active antenna

  - CD2003 receiver (< 500 INR) + random wire / active antenna

    See https://github.com/kholia/ConsensusBasedTimeSync for more details
